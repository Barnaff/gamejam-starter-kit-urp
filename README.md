# Game Jam Starter Kit

Welcome to the Game Jam Starter Kit! This is a Unity project that is designed to provide a solid foundation for your game jam project, with a variety of useful tools and utilities to get you up and running quickly. This template is Unity 2021 or later.

The kit includes the following packages:

- [SerializableDictionaryLite](https://github.com/RotaryHeart/SerializableDictionaryLite): A lightweight version of Unity's built-in serializable dictionary, allowing you to easily serialize dictionaries in the Unity Inspector.

- [Custom Hierarchy](https://github.com/febucci/unitypackage-custom-hierarchy): A tool for customizing the appearance of objects in the Unity Hierarchy window, allowing you to easily distinguish different types of objects and organize your project.

- [Extenject](https://github.com/nolimet/Extenject): A lightweight dependency injection framework for Unity, allowing you to easily manage and inject dependencies in your project.

- [UniTask](https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask): A powerful asynchronous programming library for Unity, providing an alternative to the built-in `async/await` system.

- [PlayerPrefs Editor](https://github.com/Dysman/bgTools-playerPrefsEditor): A simple editor tool for quickly viewing and editing PlayerPrefs in the Unity Inspector.

- [Animation Sequencer](https://github.com/brunomikoski/Animation-Sequencer): A simple tool for creating and previewing animation sequences in the Unity Editor.

In addition to the above packages, the template also includes the following assets within the project:

- [DOTween](http://dotween.demigiant.com/): A powerful tweening library for Unity, allowing you to easily animate objects and create smooth transitions.

- [LeanPool](https://github.com/CarlosWilkes/LeanPool): A lightweight object pooling system for Unity, helping you to optimize performance and reduce memory usage.

- [TextMesh Pro](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.textmeshpro@2.0/manual/index.html): A powerful text rendering tool for Unity, providing high-quality text rendering with advanced features such as dynamic visual text styling and improved internationalization support.

The template also includes a set of common utilities, such as singleton base classes and useful extensions, as well as a basic menu scene to get you started.

The template is also set up to use Unity's [Universal Render Pipeline (URP)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@7.1/manual/index.html). URP is a high-performance, lightweight rendering pipeline that is designed to work with a wide range of platforms and devices.

We hope these tools will help you get your game jam project off the ground and allow you to focus on creating great gameplay and content. Happy jamming!
